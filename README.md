# Student Feedback Analysis
NLP-based Sentiment Analysis of Student Feedback | Python, VADER, ML, Word Cloud
## Overview
This project analyzes student feedback using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to extract insights into sentiment, common themes, and satisfaction levels.

### Features:
**Sentiment Analysis** using **VADER NLP**  
**Word Cloud** to visualize most common phrases  
**Course Satisfaction Trends** from student reviews  
**Machine Learning Model** for predicting sentiment  

## Dataset Information
This project uses **synthetic (faux) student feedback data**, generated for **demonstration purposes**.  
The dataset does **not** contain real student responses but is structured to **mimic real-world sentiment trends**.

If applying this analysis to real-world data, ensure:
- **Ethical considerations** for student privacy.
- **Data preprocessing adjustments** based on actual dataset size.
